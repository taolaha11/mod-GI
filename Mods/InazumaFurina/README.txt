Btw, if you enjoy SFW mods, there's a discord server focused on that: https://discord.com/invite/HcgvjWFCaG
And here is my Patreon if you want to support me and get mods in early access: https://www.patreon.com/mimarimods

If the mod breaks with future updates, don't forget to check under genshin tools on gamebanana for scripts to fix all mods at once. 
Look for the most recent version of this tool (likely will be a new post): https://gamebanana.com/tools/15654 
There is no point in modders updating all of their individual posts when those fixes exist, so please don't ask. That goes for my older mods too.
