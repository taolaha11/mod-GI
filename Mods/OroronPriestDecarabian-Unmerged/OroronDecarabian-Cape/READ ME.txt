Decarabian over Oloron


Fan-interpretation of Decarabian from Old Mondstadt, continuing Anilyan's Old Mondstadt character series posted on gamebanana. 
Ngl, I'm starting to see why Amos fell in love xD

Outfit is adapted from Eternal Return, but with modifications. Full list of notes at the end.
Cape is toggable, and there is a version with Ororon's hair.

Btw, if you enjoy SFW mods, there's a discord server focused on that:

INSTRUCTIONS:
Place the download unzipped in your 3DM genshin ./mods/ folder

If you get the merge, toggle versions with H
If you get the unmerged, put only one of the subfolders  in your Mods folder.

If the mod seems broken:
- Make sure you are not using another mod for the same character. You can only have 1 mod per character in your mods folder, unless you merge them.
- Make sure that, if you downloaded the unmerged version, you are only putting one subfolder/variation in your mods folder. Otherwise, use the merge
- 3demigoto can be silly. If only small parts seem broken, go inside a domain.
- Always disable Dynamic Character Resolution in settings. That doesn't work with mods
- If the mod is old and broke with patch updates, run the more recent version of this link (has to be updated by Silent!): https://gamebanana.com/tools/16433


DETAILS ABOUT THE DESIGN:
A big chunk of this design is based on theories that Decarabian was a dragon and/or a God King.You can read more about that here https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/1go0qxx/about_ochkanatlan_decarabians_draconic_nature/
- Sunday's crown was changed to have 4 eyes kinda to hint at 4 shades, and an Eye of Storm since Decarabian was a Storm God
- Symbols associated with him are included through the textures and mesh, including the one that resembles the lawrence's symbol, and the cercelée
- Ororon's cloak is painted a bit to resemble dragon wings
- Other dvalin elements are included too, along with armor-claws and such (thank you captain)
- Other humanoid dragons that the game has, aka zhongli and neuvilete, have a certain cross-like pin on a side of their coat/suit. So I included that for Decarabian as well, since it seems like a design pattern
