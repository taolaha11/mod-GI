Liyue Cyno (Jing Yuan crossover)
When the trailer showed that Cyno and Tighnari would be present for Lantern Rite, ofc I had to make skins for them. 
But I've had little free time, so it had to be ports/kitbashes instead of custom models, adjusted to fit the Genshin character.
And what better model to use for Cyno than Jing Yuan, since they share the same ENG VA?

INSTRUCTIONS:
Place the download unzipped in your 3DM genshin ./mods/ folder
If you get the merge, toggle with P.
You need to have ORFix in your Mods » BufferValues folder https://github.com/leotorrez/LeoTools/blob/main/releases/ORFix.ini

If the mod seems broken:
- Make sure you are not using another mod for the same character. You can only have 1 mod per character in your mods folder, unless you merge them.
- 3demigoto can be silly. If only small parts seem broken, go inside a domain.
- Always disable Dynamic Character Resolution in settings. That doesn't work with mods
- If the mod is old and broke with patch updates, run the more recent version of this link (has to be updated by Silent!): https://gamebanana.com/tools/16433
